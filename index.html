        <h1>Human body parts and organs</h1>
        <section>
            <p>It goes without saying that humans (mammals identifiable as those that stand upright and are 
            comparatively advanced and capable of detailed thought) have pretty remarkable bodies, given all 
            that they've accomplished. (Furthermore, an especially intelligent human brain produced this text!) 
            To be sure, humans have overcome predators, disease, and all sorts of other obstacles over thousands 
            of years.</p>

            <p>To fully understand and appreciate these accomplishments, let's take at some of the most well-known
            parts of the human body!</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>The head, or the spherical body part that contains the brain and rests at the top of the human body,
            has quite a few individual organs and body parts on it. (It should quickly be mentioned that hair 
            occupies the space on top of the head, and the ears, the organs responsible for hearing, are located 
            on either side of the head.) From top to bottom, the eyebrows, or horizontal strips of hair that can 
            be found above the eye, are the first components of the head. The eyes are below them, and are round, 
            orb-like organs that allow humans to see.</p>

            <p>The eyes make way for the nose, or an external (sticking-out) organ that plays an important part
            in the breathing and bacteria-elimination processes. Below that is the mouth, or a wide, cavernous 
            organ that chews food, removes bacteria, helps with breathing, and more. The mouth contains teeth, 
            or small, white-colored, pointed body parts used to chew food, and the tongue, or a red-colored, 
            boneless organ used to chew food and speak.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>The neck is the long body part that connects the head to the chest (the muscular body part that 
            protects the heart and lungs), and the stomach, or the part of the body that contains food and 
            liquid-processing organs, comes below that.</p>

            <p>The legs are the long, muscular body parts that allow humans to move from one spot to another and 
            perform a variety of actions. Each leg contains a thigh (a thick, especially muscular body part 
            used to perform strenuous motions; the upper part of the leg) and a calf (thinner, more flexible 
            body part that absorbs the shock associated with movement; the lower part of the leg). Feet can be 
            found at the bottom of legs, and each foot is comprised of five toes, or small appendages that help 
            balance.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Arms are long, powerful body parts that are located on either side of chest, below the shoulders;
            arms are comprised of biceps (the thicker, more powerful upper portion), and forearms (the thinner, 
            more flexible lower portion). Hands, or small, gripping body parts used for a tremendous number 
            of actions, are at the end of arms. Each hand contains five fingers, or small appendages used to 
            grip objects.</p>

            <p>The aforementioned shoulders are rounded body parts that aid arms' flexibility. One's back is found 
            on the opposite side of the stomach, and is a flat section of the body that contains important 
            muscles that're intended to protect the lungs and other internal organs, in addition to helping 
            humans perform certain motions and actions.</p>
